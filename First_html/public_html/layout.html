        <h1> tense </h1>
        <p> tense is a category that expresses time reference with reference to the moment of speaking.[1][2] 
            Tenses are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of verbs, particularly in their conjugation patterns.<br><br>

Main tenses found in many languages include the past, present, and future. Some languages have only two distinct tenses,
such as past and nonpast, or future and nonfuture. There are also tenseless languages, like most of the Chinese languages, 
though it can possess a future and nonfuture system, which is typical of Sino-Tibetan languages.[3] Recent work by Bittner[4],
Tonnhauser[5] has described the different ways in which tenseless languages nonetheless mark time. On the other hand,
some languages make finer tense distinctions, such as remote vs recent past, or near vs remote future.<br><br>

Tenses generally express time relative to the moment of speaking. In some contexts, however,
their meaning may be relativized to a point in the past or future which is established in the discourse (the moment being spoken about).
This is called relative (as opposed to absolute) tense. Some languages have different verb forms or constructions which manifest relative tense, 
such as pluperfect ("past-in-the-past") and "future-in-the-past".</p>

           <p> Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy
American industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a child, Bruce
witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which
ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek vengeance against
criminals. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly
living off his family's fortune, which was amassed through investment in real
estate before the city became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne
Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides just outside of
Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports philanthropic causes through his
nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.
In public, he appears frequently in the company of high-status women, which
encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life,
crime-fighting accounts for most of his time</p>
